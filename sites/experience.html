      <h3>Global Threat Intelligence Intern</h3>
      <p>Created a dashboard to prioritize threat actors targeting Sony using CrowdStrike Falcon Intelligence data integrated into Sonyâ€™s ThreatConnect instance. Used the ThreatConnect API to develop a playbook to reprioritize rankings weekly, utilizing real-time intelligence from CrowdStrike Falcon. Created a proof of-concept web application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to manually score Threats targeting Sony.</p>
      <p>Proactively sought Shodan corporate trial to find publicly facing vulnerable Sony assets and generate actionable items for the Vulnerability Management team. Scanned all CVEs referenced from Sony advisories since 2021 and the CISA known exploited vulnerability catalog using the Shodan API. Utilized CrowdStrike Surface to validate these results for leadership.</p>
      <p>Wrote monthly phishing trends reports covering the major threat actors, campaign trends, and prevalent malware encountered by Sony. Leveraged Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) to extract sub company-specific information for recommendations for targeted mitigation strategies. Utilized Proofpoint TAP to conduct research into threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), to enrich the understanding of the phishing landscape relating to Sony.</p>
      <p>Responded to day-to-day tasks such as addressing requests for information (RFI), constructing Threat actor profile reports, addressing recorded future credential leak alerts, writing standard operating procedures (SOP), staying on top of recent threat actor activity using Feedly, and collaborating in briefing the Sony CISO of emerging threats.</p>
