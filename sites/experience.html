                    data integrated into Sonyâ€™s ThreatConnect instance. Used the ThreatConnect API to develop a playbook
                    to reprioritize rankings weekly, utilizing real-time intelligence from CrowdStrike Falcon. Created a proof
                    of-concept web application using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to manually score Threats targeting Sony. <br><br>
                    &#x2022; Proactively sought Shodan corporate trial to find publicly facing vulnerable Sony assets and generate
                    actionable items for the Vulnerability Management team. Scanned all CVEs referenced from Sony
                    advisories since 2021 and the CISA known exploited vulnerability catalog using the Shodan API. Utilized
                    CrowdStrike Surface to validate these results for leadership.<br><br>

                    Proofpoint TAP to conduct research into threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), to
                    enrich the understanding of the phishing landscape relating to Sony.<br><br>
                    &#x2022; Responded to day-to-day tasks such as addressing requests for information (RFI), constructing Threat
                    actor profile reports, addressing recorded future credential leak alerts, writing standard operating
                    procedures (SOP), staying on top of recent threat actor activity using Feedly, and collaborating in
                    briefing the Sony CISO of emerging threats.<br><br>
